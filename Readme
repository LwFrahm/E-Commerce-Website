# Overview of Project 
The e-commerce website will allow users to buy products. All users will be required to register and login on the website. Once logged in, users can place products 
in a cart. When users are satisfied and want to buy the products in their current cart they can select checkout. Old purchases will be put into a previous carts 
page that the user can see. Users can also update their profile. If they need to change their address or other information they will be allowed to do so.
